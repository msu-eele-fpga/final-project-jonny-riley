# Final project proposal - Jonny Hughes, Riley Holmes

## Hardware/software proposal 1
Push button that acts as a binary counter, displayed on the LED array. The binary counter will increment every time the button is pushed.
The software will allow the user to change the value that the counter increments by. The software will interact directly with one register that will change the incrementing value.

## Hardware/software proposal 2
Push button that will measure reaction time. The software will tell the person to get ready, then turn on a led. The person will then try to push the button as quickly as possible. The software will allow for the user to change how many times the test runs. The program will then display the average time across the tests. The software will interact directly with one register that will change the number of tests that will be ran and averaged.

## Extra credit

## Division of labor
We will split the labor of the implamentation of the led array because we will both use the component. 

Riley will develop his hardware component, and Jonny will implament the software involved with his hardware.
