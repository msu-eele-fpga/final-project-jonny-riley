# Final project proposal

## Hardware/software proposal 1
Push button that acts as a binary counter, displayed on the LED array. The binary counter will increment every time the button is pushed.
The software will allow the user to change the value that the counter increments by. The software will interact directly with one register that will change the incrementing value.

## Hardware/software proposal 2
Push button that will measure reaction time. The software will tell the person to get ready, then turn on a led. The person will then try to push the button as quickly as possible. The software will allow for the user to change how many times the test runs. The program will then display the average time across the tests. The software will interact directly with one register that will change the number of tests that will be ran and averaged.

## Extra credit
Define any extra credit proposals here. ???

## Division of labor
We will split the labor of the implamentation of the led array because we will both use the component. 

Riley will develop his hardware component, and Jonny will implament the software involved with his hardware.

Jonny will develop his hardware component, and Riley will implament the software involved with his hardware.

DELETE BEFORE FINAL PUSH:
Briefly describe who will be working on what. For extra credit tasks and any software above the driver level, it is okay for both group members to work on a single piece, so long as the division of labor and responsibilities are clear.
