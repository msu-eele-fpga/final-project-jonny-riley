# Software source code

## pwm_adc_miscdev_test

- This software will continously read from ADC registers into software
and convert this values to PMW duty cycles. The result can be used to controll
an RGB Led


## devmem

- This software can be used to read and write to specific memory addresses in the FPGA Memory. 
This allows us to analyze the ADC and PWM duty cycle registers from the putty terminal.
devmem allows us to quickly test the functionallity of a new platform designer device.
